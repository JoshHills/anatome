                Here's some information about the topic:
                Coming to university can be a stressful and overwhelming experience, but don’t despair!
                Understanding your feelings and how to cope is the first step to feeling like you are back on track.
                First let’s understand what depression is and how it can make you feel:
                • Extended periods of sadness
                • A feeling of hopelessness,
                • Lack of motivation and self-belief.
                • Feeling of fatigue
                • Insomnia
                The severity of these feeling can vary between students.
                For some these symptoms can subside over time, however, it is always worth being aware of how you can cope and the advice you can seek.
            </information>
            <information id="tips">
                •	Maintain a positive attitude. Try replacing negative thought with positive ones.
                •	Keep to a routine and plan your days. Having structure will make you feel more at ease.
                •	Remember, you are not the only one who feels this way, you are not alone.
                Consider reaching out to those close to you such as family and friends.
