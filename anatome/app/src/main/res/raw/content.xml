                Take a deep breath in and count to 5, Remember we are here to help

                Coming to university can be a stressful and overwhelming experience, but don’t despair!
                Understanding your feelings and how to cope is the first step to feeling like you are back on track.

                First let’s understand what depression is and how it can make you feel:
                Students that experience depression may suffer from extended periods of sadness, a feeling of hopelessness, lack of motivation and self-belief.
                It is also worth noting that depression can also affect how you feel physically.
                Signs of this may include a feeling of fatigue, insomnia or constant sleeping.
                The severity of these feeling can vary between students.
                For some these symptoms can subside over time, however, it is always worth being aware of how you can cope and the advice you can seek.
